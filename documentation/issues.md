## Issues:

### Priority Issues:

**Improve authentication handling**
For sign up: currently, the requirement for password is simply a length requirement (length>6). There needs to be better requirements. There also needs to be better error handling (e.g. alerts for weak passwords, better error messages for unsuccessful signups)
For log in: there needs to be better, more descriptive error messages (possiblly alerts) for when log in is unsuccessful

**Log out issue**
Currently, it takes 2 clicks on the Log Out button to log out. Fix so it takes only 1 click.

### Other Issues:
