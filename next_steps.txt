TASKS

TROUBLESHOOT
1. carry the buttons through when adding a goal
2. DONE separately style the "category" of each goal/achievement/note
3. right now, the tasks are all algebratically ordered
4. DONE showing all existing tasks onload
5. DONE test if appending just the new one works 
    -> if not, might need to reload the page everytime a new task is added
6. change category into a dropdown
