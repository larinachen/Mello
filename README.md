Mello is a web application that helps students commit to developing wellbeing skills and practices by making it simple. 
We help users break down vague goals and elaborate plans into simple, concrete action items, and provides motivation and resources to help them do so.

I worked on this project from December 2020 through March 2021. This is my first full-fledged web application built in html, css, javascript, and Firebase from scratch â€“ 
for a first project, I'm happy on how it turned out and even happier about how much it has pushed me to learn about web dev, design process, and entrepreneurship.
I will continue to debug and add to this project when I have free time ~
